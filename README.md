# 2026 Embedded Software Training

Thank you for coming to our 2026 Embedded Software training.
In this training, we will set up all the necessary tools for doing MRDT embedded development.
We will then cover the basics of the Arduino framework with a simple example project.

## What you need

- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for your computer
- Install [git](https://git-scm.com/install/)
  - GitHub Desktop will *work*, but you'll need to install git by itself to access VS Code's git integration features
- Install the Platform IO plugin for VS Code from the extensions tab on the left

## What we'll cover

- Basic git usage through VS Code
- Project structure
- Header and source files
- The Arduino framework
- Driving LEDs
- Driving servos
- Adding dependencies in Platform IO
- Communicating over RoveComm
